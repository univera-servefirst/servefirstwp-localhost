Mark a post to be placed at the top of a specified category archive. It's sticky posts specifically for categories.

== Description ==

Category Sticky Post allows you to mark a post to be displayed - or stuck - to the top of each archive page for the specified
category.

Category Sticky Post...

* Allows you to select which category in which to stick a post
* Will display the post on the top of the first page of the archive just like built-in sticky posts
* Will only allow you to stick a single post per category
* Displays whether or not a post is stuck in a category on the Post Edit dashboard
* Provides light styling that should look good in most themes
* Is available on each post editor page
